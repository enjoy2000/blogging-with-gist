# Blogging with Gist
TODO Add badges

This is a project that I built by [Rekit](https://github.com/supnate/rekit).
Which is using [Gist API](https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/) to create a mini blog with some features:
- Creating blog with title
- Listing Comments
- Adding Comments

### Demo

- Redux middleware to inject auth token better
- Server side handling Github access token
